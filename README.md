# Trade ategorization System
UBS AG, .NET Developer Test

# Description
This project is a .NET-based system designed for categorizing bank trades with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
Utilizing the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and adhering to SOLID principles, it showcases an implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to efficiently manage and categorize trades in a banking portfolio.

# Features
Dynamic Trade Categorization:
Leverages a strategy pattern to categorize trades into predefined categories such as LOWRISK, MEDIUMRISK, and HIGHRISK based on the trade's value and the client's sector.
This system is designed to easily accommodate new categories or modification of existing ones without impacting the core functionality.

Design Pattern Implementation:
Utilizes several design patterns including Strategy, Factory and Facade, to ensure the system's extensibility and maintainability.

Comprehensive Data Management: 
Integrates with relational databases as SQL Server for robust data administration. It also includes store procedures for categorizing bank trades.

Agile Development Practices:
Developed using Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban to optimize workflows, enhance team productivity, and ensure timely delivery of software solutions.
